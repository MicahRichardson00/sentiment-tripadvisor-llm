{"text": "This hotel is truly amazing, from the building, to the location, the rooms, the ambiance, and the staff. I stayed at the Ace Brooklyn on a road trip from Detroit with my dog. The experience of the stay was great even from before booking when I called to make sure it was okay to bring my very large dog--they are super dog friendly and it showed as soon as we got there! The staff was incredible and made my dog and me feel like we were home. I especially loved the night front desk staff; they were so friendly and even gave me great parking advice (it was super easy to park for free on the street by the way)!  The vibe of the rooms and the common areas is so hip but also inviting. I loved the design of the rooms and how they were super thoughtfully planned, right down to the light switch controls (which allowed dimming on all light fixtures and also the ability to turn all lights off at once by the bed AND front door). The furnishings are gorgeous, the bed and pillows are remarkably comfortable, and the room even had a turntable to play music. As a sustainability professional, I really appreciated the local, vintage, and small business sourcing for furniture and other furnishings.  One of the best parts of the room is the shower as well! I wanted to take it home with me. It's gorgeously designed but also the quality and water pressure are great.  This is my go-to from now on when I come to NYC. I already have my next stay booked in February for my friends' wedding! My dog and I both were in love with this hotel and enjoyed our stay thoroughly."}
{"text": "The staff was terrific!. Geneva and Sergio were very accommodating and super friendly. Lets not forget Mike who helped with our baggage and  getting a car after my Lyft cancelled. The Loft was amazing and with a great view and yummy treats. The decor was not the usual chain hotel variety. Modern and artistic. I loved it! I only wish I was staying more then 1 night  Thank you for helping to make my stay a memorable one."}
{"text": "Amazing stay for our first evening in Brooklyn. Very genuine, nice staff who were very accommodating with our extra needs this trip (tons of luggage with moving, etc). Beautiful, simple elegance to the room design that is actually functional (bathroom towel hangers, and coat luggage entry) and to finish off beautiful local artist works in each room and lobby area that is super inspiring. Love the robes, and the products in the room. Overall great experience!"}
{"text": "What an amazing place! Clean, quiet rooms and funky decor! We had a vinyl player I could control inside my room and it was beautiful. The hotel bar and restaurant areas are elegant. The employees however, were the winners! They were cheerful, happy to help and exceeded my expectations."}
{"text": "Huge thank you to Darren at the front desk who helped find my expensive item I had left behind. He was so sweet and helpful and made me feel so well taken care of - even going to search my room himself while I waited on the phone!! Also huge thanks to their honest and hardworking housekeeping staff who turned in my item. Every staff member we interacted with over the weekend was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel lobby/bar is gorgeous and stylish. The rooms are clean, retro and fun. They make good use of their space and the king bed was super comfy.  I am a crazy light sleeper and the helpful front desk attendant (didn\u2019t catch her name), put us in a room on the 8th floor. I slept great all weekend. No street noise and very minimal hallway noise.  My only tip to the hotel would be to add some type of coffee maker to the room. I wanted a coffee while getting ready late afternoon and there was literally no coffee to be had in the whole hotel (none in room and lobby cafe closed). This is an easy fix but would be much appreciated for guests!  Thanks for a great stay :)"}
{"text": "As a newly former New Yorker, I am now always driving into the city for appointments and meetings and have been bouncing around trying out different hotels in Manhattan and Brooklyn. My room at the Ace BK was fine, nothing spectacular nor terrible, but the staff at this hotel is hands down the best I have encountered. I arrived at the Ace thinking I would move on to another hotel next trip but the experience I had there with the staff changed my mind completely. The bellman (Michael or was it Tony?, forgive me I'm blanking on the name) is just the best human. He so enthusiastically helped me so many times and went above and beyond for my partner and I throughout our entire trip. Additionally, every single person at the front desk was so accommodating and friendly at check in, with help printing, with deliveries, etc. I am really so pleasantly surprised that even with all of us being so incredibly spent mentally after these pandemic years, everyone at the Ace Hotel Brooklyn was just so lovely and I sincerely hope they are being compensated fairly for their excellent work. I will be back!"}
{"text": "Lovely hotel in great location. I was here for three nights for work and the space, and room were perfect. Nice quiet rooms, good food options (though for us jetlagged travellers wouldn't mind if the restaurant opened a bit earlier), and really friendly staff. Only small niggle is there's no coffee in the rooms but wouldn't hesitate to come back here again."}
{"text": "Love the Ace Hotel Brooklyn, great spot for brunch and drinks. Design, furnishing and staff are great. Lots of room in the dining area and menu is full of fresh hits, the pastries are a gem. Even though its a hotel, it's become a local's spot, not a lot of place like that in the neighborhood."}
{"text": "The is another gimmicky NYC hotel with undersized rooms and high prices. My room had an acoustic guitar hanging on a wall and another guest room had a turntable. So what?  I had to climb over my wife to get out of bed due to the room size. First time in my life that I was in a hotel room with no coffee. The nice staff kept this from being a two star review"}
{"text": "Couldn\u2019t stop singing the praises for my experience here.  The hospitality showed reflected a warmth and kindness not always associated with big city living. The staff was knowledgeable patient and helpful to myself and all of my guests throughout our stay. The sound proof rooms allowed you to have peace in your own space or in our case not disturb others peace with our loud noise. The rooms came with guitars, record players and Bluetooth speakers helping you to make the space feel even more at home. This was made complete by the beautiful city views from the rooms massive windows.  The bathrooms while unique to each room were well thought out. From the large showers to the double vanity\u2019s. The full length mirrors to the waterfall showers. The self care kits that come complimentary and their excellent choice of hypoallergenic soaps/hair care products.  The attached restaurant and bar were both just as warm and welcoming as the hotel staff itself. The bartenders were not only good at their job but knowledgeable about the surrounding areas drinking scene. The restaurant allowed me to have options despite my elaborate list of allergies. So wether your vegan, gluten free, keto, or hungover they will have something for you.  A big shout of praise to all of the staff that worked with me and my group specifically during the trip. Eager to come back and see you all again!"}
{"text": "My stay at Ace brooklyn was excellent. By far, the best Ace location I've been to thus far. Location is great, I stayed here as a mini staycation for a BAM show, and had a wonderful time. Beautiful building, with As you Are, their little restaurant/diner, being a huge highlight. Loved working out in their retro gym during a snow day, looking out at the snow. The staff is delightful and really kind, which makes a huge difference. I paid for the Deluxe room, which I wished was just a little bit larger. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. The downstairs lounge/bar area was bustling, and its nice to see hospitality back again at full force."}
{"text": "Stayed at the ACE Brooklyn and had a fantastic stay. The service was super friendly and always ready to answer a question or help with whatever. The room was super cozy and felt like a styled apartment with tons of little details and even a guitar to play. We didn't have a chance to try the restaurant downstairs, but heard really great things from other guests that did, next time we will definitely check it out. All in all, it was a great visit and I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text": "First the good, room is nice and spacious for a \u201csmall\u201d and the bed is very comfortable. Lovely massive windows so it\u2019s nice and bright in here.  The not so good, the windows are filthy, the HVAC unit is incredibly noisy but luckily isn\u2019t on for long, the carpet has seen better days and there\u2019s an attempted taping down of a rug with duct tape.  The worst, and possibly unforgivable thing, is the lack of coffee in rooms. Apparently it\u2019s cause they want you to pay for the coffee from the coffee shop downstairs but that doesn\u2019t open till 7:30. According to the front desk, they\u2019ve had complaints since 5:30 this morning (and is a regular issue) from other guests and yet won\u2019t provide coffee machines in the rooms. As someone who has several cups a day I would happily buy one or two from your cafe but I require one earlier than 7:30 am. Sort it out."}
{"text": "Showerhead nice and high. Quiet. Comfortable bed. Storage limited. Thermostat complicated. Water-pressure low. Pot to boil water but no tea or coffee to put in it. Bring your own instant coffee. Good food in restaurant."}
{"text": "Everything you could want in a hotel: gorgeous design; clean & comfortable rooms; attentive staff. Fantastic location made it easy to get anywhere in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Great value, too!"}
{"text": "When we checked in, the room's toilet didn't flush and the sink took minutes to drain. The sink was never fixed, and we were additionally charged for mini-bar items that we did not take.  Having just arrived in the city, we went up to the room to drop our bags off and freshen up before heading out to meet local family for dinner. Unfortunately, the inoperable bathroom prevented any freshening-up and delayed our plans. (Lest you think, dear reader, that I was the cause of the clog, let me assure you that the first attempted use of the toilet was a purely liquid affair. Upon that initial flush attempt, the bowl filled with water and a q-tip worked its way out from the drain pipe and into the bowl. Gross.)  We called the front desk to report the issue, and they said they would send someone up to look at it. Twenty minutes later, with no word from the staff, we had to leave to make our dinner plans, and on the way out the front desk said that they didn't know when they would fix our room but if the problem wasn't fixed by the time we got back, the desk could arrange a room move for us.  When we returned later that evening, the desk told us everything was fixed, but the sink didn't drain any faster, and it was only barely usable. The toilet at least did work.  I have better things to do on a weekend trip to New York than move hotel rooms in the middle of the night or get angry at hotel staff; for a two night stay, well, the damage had already been done.  Finally, the mini-bar charge appeared on my credit card a couple days after my stay. I called the hotel to have it refunded, and they obliged, naturally. But at this point I can't say that I was surprised.  Pros:  + pretty cute design  + good coffee in the attached bakery  Cons:  - inoperable bathroom  - not clear that it was actually cleaned between guests  - unclear what you're paying for if not the staff to do that very cleaning"}
{"text": "Large but intimate space. Not your typical hotel lobby bar.  Somehow concrete  pillars were made to look warm.   lots of seating for groups.  The drinks are NYC  priced but good.  I enjoyed  the crispy  Brussel sprouts  with gribiche (if you've  never heard of it it's  delicious)  despite  its creaminess it does not have milk."}
{"text": "I was happy with my stay here. The room was comfortable, very nicely designed, and equipped with what I needed. Only downside was that the shower didn\u2019t really get hot enough for my taste. Enjoyed my stay and would stay again."}
{"text": "I feel like this newly opened hotel is still finding it's footing, but it still holds up to the Ace brand. Every element is deeply connected to the design, from the gorgeous entrance to the \"mission-century modern\" furniture, it feels like a movie set from an unknown mishmash of eras. Wood and concrete surround you, rooms are equipped with record players and guitars, and the staff is warm and friendly.  It's missing some of the touches I'd expect from a hotel of this caliber. For example: hot water kettle in room but no tea or coffee; adorable SMEG mini fridge, but no bottled water. Two hair dryers for some reason, but very few toiletries (I'm a fan of the bulk bottles attached to the wall - more environmentally friendly!). Our TV wouldn't turn on and the remote was covered in a sticky substance but \"engineer\" Johnny was fast and incredibly helpful to get us all fixed up. The hoodie robes are a great element for staying cozy and the room was beautiful.  All in all a great stay and a good addition to the NYC hotel scene."}
{"text": "Great spot, good prices and clean rooms. Decor is contemporary, decent bar in the lobby. Staff pleasant and accomodating."}
